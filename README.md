# dotfiles

current config for macOS Big Sur

thinking of getting a new computer soon and needed to publish this for myself, some useless stuff is git-ignored since i won't need them.
basically:
    iterm (alternate terminal)
    bat (cat, with syntax highlighting)
    yabai (tiling window manager)
    skhd (hotkey daemon)
