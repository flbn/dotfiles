# dotfiles

current config for macOS Big Sur

thinking of getting a new computer soon and needed to publish this for myself, some useless stuff is git-ignored since i won't need them.
basically:
    
    iterm (alternate terminal)
    
    bat (cat, with syntax highlighting)
    
    neofetch (command-line system info)
    
    nano (GNU nano, version 5.7. brew install -> create alias in .zshrc)
    
    yabai (tiling window manager)
    
    skhd (hotkey daemon)
